Requirements
---

The game should have a menu of functions

- Option 1 - Instructions
The game should tell the user the instructions to the game

- Option 2 - Play Game
Then the game will ask for the number of players
Then ask for the names of the players
Then the game will give the card to player #1

- Player #1 will answer the question
If the answer is correct, the player will receive three points
If the answer is incorrect, the player will lose one point and be able to try again
Once the question is answered the game should confirm the correct answer show the leaderboard and move on to the next player and next question
A user should be able to skip their turn (if they want)
After everyone has had a turn the game should show the current leader and ask if the players want to play another round
There should be at least 10 cards to start the game by default

- Option 3 - Add New Cards
The user should be able to add the card (question & answer) and any other relevant data to the application.  
The game should confirm the user’s input has been added and show the last 3 cards that have been added to the system

Considerations
---
What did you do to make sure that the answers that users enter match what is saved on the card? (i.e. typos, case sensitivity, etc.) How is the card data being stored? What data structure is used? Why was that ADT chosen compared to other ADTs? Assume that the number of cards can be a very large number.
